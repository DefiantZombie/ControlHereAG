# ControlHereAG

Adds an action group entry for "Control From Here" to docking ports and command capable parts.

Do note that if for some reason a part is both a docking port and a command module, the docking port will take priority.

## Installation

1. !!!IMPORTANT!!! If going from KSP 1.2.2 to 1.3, delete the old Collide-o-Scope folder.

2. Install [ModuleManager](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-121-module-manager-275-november-29th-2016-better-late-than-never/) or use the provided version (may be out of date!)

3. Copy Squidsoft Collective into your KSP/GameData folder. Allow files to be overwritten if necessary. OS X Note: You will have to go one level deeper and copy/merge the folders inside Squidsoft Collective into your KSP/GameData/Squidsoft Collective folder.

## Usage

1. Enable Advanced Tweakables for your save.
2. Add the new "Control From Here" action in the SPH or VAB just like any other action.
